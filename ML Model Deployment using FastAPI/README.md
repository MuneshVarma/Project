## Overview
Deployment is the method by which you integrate a machine learning model into an existing production environment to
 make practical business decisions based on data. It is one of the last stages in the machine learning life cycle and
  can be one of the most cumbersome.
  In order to start using a model for practical decision-making, it needs to be effectively deployed into production. If you cannot reliably
   get practical insights from your model, then the impact of the model is severely limited.
   In order to get the most value out of machine learning models, it is important to seamlessly deploy them into production so a business can start using them to make practical decisions.

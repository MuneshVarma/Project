## Overview
Deployment  is one of the last stages in the machine learning life 
cycle and can be one of the most cumbersome. In order to start using 
a model for practical decision-making, it needs to be effectively 
deployed into production. If you cannot reliably get practical insights 
from your model, then the impact of the model is severely limited. 
In order to get the most value out of machine learning models, it 
is important to seamlessly deploy them into production so a business 
can start using them to make practical decisions.
## Problem Statement
To build a CredScore software application that gives flixibility to
loan administrator to define parameters (features) for any loan product
(personal loan, vehicle loan, etc.). Loan officer can access loan 
applicant's data of a particular loan product that he/she has access and
perform machine learning based assessment to accept or reject a loan application.

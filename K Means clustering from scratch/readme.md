## Overview
Although Inbuilt libraries provide K Means on the go, knowing how to implement it from scratch can help in better understanding of the algorithm. Also implement K Means from scratch is a typical question asked during interviews.

## Problem Statement
Implement K means with only using numpy. The number of observations and number of clusters will be inputed by the user. Each data point will be generated randomly. The output will be a list which segregates data points based on Euclidean distance.

## Methodology
1) The number of data points and number of clusters are inputed by the user.
2) make_blobs functions from sklearn.datasets was used to create artificial data centers were equal to number of clusters and n_samples were equal to data point count.
3) Scatter plot shows 3 visible clusters.
4)  
5) 

## Technology Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python

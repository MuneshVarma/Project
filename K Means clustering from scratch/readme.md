## Overview
Although Inbuilt libraries provide K Means on the go, knowing how to implement it from scratch can help in better understanding of the algorithm. Also implement K Means from scratch is a typical question asked during interviews.

## Problem Statement
Implement K means with only using numpy. The number of observations and number of clusters will be inputed by the user. Each data point will be generated randomly. The output will be a list which segregates data points based on Euclidean distance.

## Methodology

# Anomaly detection
An oil and gas company with several offshore platforms is experimenting with anomaly detection on one
of its platforms. An analyst has provided you with sample data for the pilot platform
( anomaly_detection.csv ). The data is a time series dataset, consisting of average daily readings from 5
sensors between 01/01/2016 and 12/30/2016. You can assume that data preprocessing (filling missing
values, scaling, etc) has been handled by the analyst. You can also assume that the daily readings are
independent and identically distributed.

The analyst has reviewed operation notes for the first 9 months (01/01/2016 to 09/30/2016) and
identified that there were issues on the platform between 02/14/2016 and 02/21/2016. The analyst did
not have time to review the final 3 months of data.

Use the first 9 months of data (01/01/2016 to 09/30/2016) to develop an anomaly detection model and
test it on the final 3 months of data (10/01/2016 to 12/30/2016). How many anomalous periods were
identified in the test period between 10/01/2016 and 12/30/2016? Only report anomalies that last
longer than 2 days. Additionally, if an anomaly lasts for longer than 14 days, we consider that behavior
to be the new normal, and we do not report it.

Hint: There are multiple potential approaches to solving this problem. One acceptable solution to this
problem is to train a PCA model on normal data. Given new data, risk can be computed as the difference
between the input data and reconstructed data, where reconstructed data is the result of compressing
and decompressing the input data using PCA.
